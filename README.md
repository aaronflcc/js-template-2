# js-template-2

Simple templates for html, css, and JavaScript files for use in JavaScript Intro classwork.

## Updates

Every semester it is worth updating at least the look, but often the code structure dates compared to trends and advances especially in JavaScript.

### Spring 2021

* Use open Google fonts (rather than a system font fallback sequence)
* Changed first input to a number type
* Removed form tags
* Changed to relying on AddEventListener("click", functionName) for buttons for increased flexibility in naming from JS
* let and const instead of var
* moved script element referencing .js file to bottom of body rather than rely on eventListener for body loading, making hooks to html simpler...
* Added list of const references to top of JS
* More explanatory comments throughout
* Cleaner simple rounded button shape

### Spring 2020
* Colors and look reduced for simplicity
* Other coding changes...
